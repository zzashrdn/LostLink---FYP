LostLink is a centralized, web-based platform developed for the students and staff of Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) to streamline the process of reporting, searching, and retrieving misplaced belongings. Created as a secure and traceable alternative to informal methods like WhatsApp or Telegram, the project aligns with SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities by enhancing campus connectivity and service efficiency. The system features a dual-role interface that provides tailored access for both normal users and administrators, allowing for detailed item reporting with photo uploads and efficient discovery through smart search and filtering tools. To ensure system integrity and prevent false ownership, LostLink incorporates an admin dashboard for oversight and a robust claim verification process powered by security questions and administrative approval.

Built using a modern tech stack, the application utilizes a Python Flask backend and a MySQL relational database to manage complex data relationships, such as user profiles and item records. The frontend is crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the Jinja2 templating engine to deliver dynamic content within a modular system architecture. Security is a core priority of the design, featuring password hashing to protect user data. The effectiveness of the system was validated through rigorous testing, where it achieved a perfect 5.0/5.0 rating for usability and overall satisfaction. Furthermore, LostLink demonstrated high performance with an average response time score of 4.5/5.0 and established significant user trust through its innovative security question verification method.
